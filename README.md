# Bias Mitigation 🧠⚖️

A web-based tool designed to detect and reduce algorithmic bias in machine learning models. This project was developed as part of **Pentathon 2.0 – Datathon 2.0**, organized by **NextGen AI** at SRM Institute of Science and Technology.

## 🔍 Objective

The goal of this project is to promote fairness and equity in AI systems by identifying and mitigating bias present in datasets and ML models. Using popular fairness metrics and mitigation algorithms, the tool provides transparency and corrective actions.

- Bias mitigation techniques using IBM’s AIF360 library.
- Visual comparison of model fairness before and after mitigation.
- Flask-based frontend for user interaction and data upload.
- Support for custom datasets.
